 * The guardian that patrols the ruins of stage 5.
 *
 * Unlike every other hazard in the game, the guardian is NOT a pure function
 * of time: it reacts to where the players are, and that is state rather than a
 * formula. So it is simulated by the server and replicated, and the kill is
 * decided on the server tick from the server's own position for it.
 *
 * Its territory is DERIVED from the ruins arena the floor is laid on, rather
 * than authored separately - an guardian whose patrol range and whose floor
 * disagree is one that walks off the edge of its own stage.
