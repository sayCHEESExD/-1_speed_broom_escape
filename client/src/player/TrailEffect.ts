/**
 * How many segments the ribbon remembers.
 *
 * Raised from 26 (+19%) because the tail was hard to pick out behind the mount
 * at low speed.
 *
 * This is the PROPORTIONAL knob, and that is why it was the one moved. The
 * ribbon's length is `SEGMENTS` times the gap between emitted points, whatever
 * that gap turns out to be, so a change here scales the ribbon by the same
 * percentage at every speed and on every machine - it cannot help a walk at the
 * cost of turning a gallop into a banner.
 *
 * SEGMENTS rather than STEP also leaves the LOOK alone: the fade and the taper
 * are normalised over the live point count (`t = i / (count - 1)`), so more
 * points lengthen the ribbon while its density and its dissolve stay exactly as
 * authored. Stretching the same 26 points would read as a coarser band.
 *
 * Be aware of what the gap actually is before tuning it further - see the
 * emission test in `update`, which does not currently gate on STEP.

 * so streamed out of the legs rather than off the mount - the reason the trail
 * read as detached. Every broom's barrel spans `belly` to `belly + bodyH`,
 * derived from its `riderOffset`, and those spans run from 1.27..2.70 on the
 * dragon to 1.85..3.25 on the deer: 2.0 is the LOWEST height inside all ten,
 * which is the smallest raise that attaches the ribbon to every mount rather
 * than only to the tall ones.
 *
 * Nothing else moves with it. The emission rule compares against this offset
