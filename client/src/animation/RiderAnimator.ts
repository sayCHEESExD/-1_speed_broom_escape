/**
 * The rider's animator.
 *
 * The player is a PASSENGER, and this file is what makes that read. There is
 * exactly one looping animation - the seated ride - plus secondary motion
 * layered on top: a bounce against the broom's sway, a forward tuck at speed,
 * a HAUL FORWARD into a climb, and a slump as the broom goes over.
 *
 * Crucially the walking animation NEVER plays. A rider whose legs cycle while
 * they sit astride a broom is the single most obvious way a mounted character
 * looks wrong, so the locomotion cycle simply does not exist on this side of
 * the mount.
 *
 * The climb layer is the half that matters for this game. The broom pitches
 * its nose up under thrust; if the rider merely went with it they would read
 * as being tipped backward off the seat. Leaning them FORWARD against that
 * pitch - and reaching the arms out along the shaft - is what turns the same
 * rotation into someone driving a climb.
 *
 * Like the previous game's animator, it writes ONLY to bones and to the
 * supplied visual node. It cannot move the mount, change velocity or decide a
 * gameplay outcome.
