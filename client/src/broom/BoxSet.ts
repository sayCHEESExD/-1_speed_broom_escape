 * A pile of coloured boxes that becomes ONE geometry.

 * Every broom in this game is built from boxes, which is what keeps the
 * silhouettes toy-brick and the file size at zero - there is not a single
 * model asset in the build. Merging them into one vertex-coloured geometry per
 * moving part is what keeps that cheap at runtime too: a ten-broom lobby is
 * about seventy meshes sharing one material, not seven hundred.
 *
 * Colours are baked into vertices rather than materials, so the whole roster
 * renders with a SINGLE `MeshLambertMaterial` and no per-broom uploads.
