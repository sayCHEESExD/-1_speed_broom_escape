/**
 * Everything in the world that moves and kills.
 *
 * Every position here is a PURE FUNCTION of the server's clock: the server
 * evaluates `hazardPositionAt` against its own elapsed time to decide a death,
 * and this evaluates the identical function against the replicated value to
 * draw the thing. The two cannot disagree, because there is nothing to
 * disagree about - no hazard state is on the wire at all.
 *
 * Six kinds share one update loop and five shapes. A ball sweeps or rolls, a
 * bar segment orbits, masonry falls, a funnel drifts and a SPIKE simply sits
 * there - and which one a hazard is affects only what geometry it was given at
 * construction. The motion, and therefore the kill, is the same code for all
 * of them, which is exactly why a static spike bed cost this file a shape and
 * a case and nothing else.
