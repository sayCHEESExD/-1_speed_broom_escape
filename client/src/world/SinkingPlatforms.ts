 * The platforms of stage 3 that drop into the quicksand.
 *
 * Their height is a PURE FUNCTION of the replicated clock, evaluated by the
 * exact same `sinkingOffsetAt` the server collides against - so the platform
 * the player can see is the platform they can stand on, with nothing
 * replicated per platform and nothing to drift.
 *
 * The warning is the whole mechanic: a platform shakes visibly and flushes
 * toward a warning colour for a beat before it goes, so crossing this stage is
 * a decision rather than a coin flip. One material is swapped for another
 * rather than tinted per-mesh, so a field of platforms is still two draw
 * states.
