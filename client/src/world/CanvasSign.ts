 * WIDTH, so any long string - "TRAINING", "60.0K Wins Required", "+3 Speed" on
 * a narrow label - simply ran off both ends of the canvas and was clipped by
 * the texture edge. The stroke made it worse: `strokeText` paints half a line
 * width OUTSIDE the glyphs, so even text that technically fitted lost the
 * outline on its first and last characters.
 *
 * So: reserve padding for the stroke, measure, and shrink until it fits. The
 * panels themselves are also authored wide enough that the shrink rarely has
 * to do anything - the fix is not "make the text small", it is "never let the
 * text exceed the space it was given".
