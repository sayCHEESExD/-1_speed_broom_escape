 * rules for each are different - a canvas sign is measured and shrunk to fit
 * its panel, and a supplied image is used exactly as it is.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS THE ASPECT RATIO IS DRIVEN, NEVER SET. The caller gives a
 * height; the width comes from the image once it has loaded. Setting both is
 * how a piece of supplied art gets squashed, and it is the same rule the HUD
 * icons follow in CSS.
 *
 * The texture is CACHED by URL. Thirty win pads all hang the same trophy, and
 * thirty decodes of one file would be thirty copies of it on the GPU.
