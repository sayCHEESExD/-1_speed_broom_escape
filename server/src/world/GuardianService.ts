 * because it chases: its position depends on where the players are, which is
 * state. So the SERVER owns it outright - it picks a target from the
 * authoritative positions it already has, moves the guardian, and decides the
 * kill from its own numbers. The client receives x, z, yaw and a charging flag
 * and does nothing but draw them.
 *
 * There is no guardian message. A client cannot move it, cannot claim to have
 * dodged it, and cannot avoid being hit by it.
