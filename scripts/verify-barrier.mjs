/**
 * The hard end barrier, after the Level 30 finish.
 *
 * There is no wall object. The end of the world is a CLAMP on Z, applied in
 * `clampToBounds` after every substep has already integrated, and that is
 * deliberately stronger than a collider could be:
 *
 *   - it cannot be tunnelled, because it is applied to the RESULT of a move
 *     rather than tested against the path of one, so no speed outruns it;
 *   - it cannot be jumped, because it constrains Z and says nothing about Y -
 *     there is no top to clear;
 *   - it cannot be flanked, because it applies at every X;
 *   - it cannot be seen, because it is not geometry.
 *
 * This drives the real simulation at it from every direction and speed the
 * game can produce and asserts nothing ever gets past.
